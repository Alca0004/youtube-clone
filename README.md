This is a basic Youtube clone that mocks the UI of the main explore page.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## How to run

1. `$ git clone git@github.com:Alca0004/netflix-clone.git`
2. `$ npm i`
3. `$ npm start`

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!
